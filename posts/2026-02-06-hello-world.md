## Welcome

Hey, I'm Chase — a cloud architect and AI engineer. This blog is where I'll share what I'm learning, building, and thinking about.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Cloud Architecture** — designing scalable infrastructure on Azure, AWS, and beyond
- **AI Engineering** — building intelligent systems, from LLM integrations to agent frameworks
- **DevOps & Automation** — CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and developer experience
- **Projects** — deep dives into things I'm building

## The Stack

This site is built with Next.js 16, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It's statically exported to GitHub Pages. Blog content lives in a [separate repo](https://github.com/mrcloudchase/mrcloudchase-blog) and gets fetched at build time.

The terminal aesthetic is intentional — I spend most of my day in a terminal, so it felt right.

## Let's Go

More posts coming soon. In the meantime, check out my [projects](/projects/) or connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mrcloudchase).

```bash
$ echo "Stay tuned."
Stay tuned.
```
